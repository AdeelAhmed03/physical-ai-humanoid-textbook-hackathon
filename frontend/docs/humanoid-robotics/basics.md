# Basics of Humanoid Robotics

Humanoid robotics is a branch of robotics focused on creating robots with human-like form and behavior. These robots typically have a head, torso, two arms, and two legs, though some variations exist.

## Anatomy of Humanoid Robots

Humanoid robots are characterized by their human-like structure:

- **Head**: Usually contains cameras, sensors, and sometimes a screen for facial expressions
- **Torso**: Houses the main control systems and power sources
- **Arms**: Typically have shoulders, elbows, wrists, and hands/dexterity
- **Legs**: Designed for walking, balancing, and supporting the robot's weight

## Key Technologies

Humanoid robotics integrates several technologies:

- Actuators for movement
- Sensors for environmental awareness
- Control systems for balance and coordination
- AI for decision making and interaction

## Applications

Humanoid robots are used in various fields:

- Customer service
- Healthcare assistance
- Education
- Research
- Entertainment
- Domestic assistance

## Challenges

Creating effective humanoid robots presents numerous challenges:

- Maintaining balance
- Human-like movement
- Natural interaction
- Energy efficiency
- Cost
